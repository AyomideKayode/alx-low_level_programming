Welcome to the world of C programming language.
This repo will contain all my projects folders for tasks done in C while learning in the ALX SE program.

Project 0: Hello World in C. Contains the foundations teaching of navigating the world of C programming language.
Project 1: C - Variables, If, Else and While. 
Project 2: C - Functions and Nested Loops.
Project 3: C - Debugging. This project no funny at all. We weren't even provide with the "see details" option checker offers, which I believe is on purpose. Debugging really is a skill on its own.
Project 4: C - More Functions and Nested Loop.
Project 5: C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings.
