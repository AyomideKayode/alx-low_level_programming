## <div align="center">Welcome to the world of C programming language.😎🤗</div>

### <div align="center">This repo will contain all my projects folders for tasks done in C while learning in the ALX SE program.🥴</div>

#### <div align="center">🌱 I’m currently learning C Programming Language. With tasks from the ALX framework.</div>

#### <div align="center">🔭 I’m currently working on a Task from one of the numerous ALX Projects I have, as you can see from the list below. LOL.😁</div>

- Project 0: Hello World in C. Contains the foundations teaching of navigating the world of C programming language.

- Project 1: C - Variables, If, Else and While. 

- Project 2: C - Functions and Nested Loops.

- Project 3: C - Debugging. This project no funny at all. We weren't even provide with the "see details" option checker offers, which I believe is on purpose. Debugging really is a skill on its own.

- Project 4: C - More Functions and Nested Loop.

- Project 5: C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings.

- Project 6: C - More Pointers, Arrays and Strings.

- Project 7: Even more Pointers, Arrays and Strings. (At this point, be like say i go fight person. Lol)

- Project 8: Recursion - A function that calls itself in itself. You get to understand factorials too.

- Project 9: Static libraries.

- Project 10: Argument Counts and Argument Vectors. 

- Project 11: Dynamic and Automatic Allocation. 

- Project 12: More Malloc Free.

- Project 13: Preprocessors.

- Project 14: Structures, typedef.

- Project 15: Function Pointers.

- Project 16: Variadic Functions.
