# C is FUN üòä

>ü•¥Yeah, said every programmer ever.

# <div align="center">Welcome to the world of C programming language.üòéü§ó</div>
### <div align="center">üå± I‚Äôm currently learning C Programming Language. With tasks from the ALX framework.</div>

## About

- This repository consists of all the C programming projects doneü•¥ in the [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course by [Ayomide Kayode](https://github.com/AyomideKayode).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We (the students) build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.

---

- [0x00](./0x00-hello_world) : Hello, World. Contains the foundations teaching of navigating the world of C programming language.
- [0x01](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) : Variables,if,else,while.
- [0x02](./0x02-functions_nested_loops) : Functions and Nested loops.
- [0x03](./0x03-debugging) : Debugging. This project no funny at all. We weren't even provide with the "see details" option checker offers, which I believe is on purpose. Debugging really is a skill on its own.
- [0x04](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) : More Functions and Nested Loops.
- [0x05](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) : Pointers, Arrays and Strings.
- [0x06](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) : More Pointers, Arrays and Strings.
- [0x07](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings) :  Even more Pointers, Arrays and Strings. (At this point, I'm ready to fight people. Lol)
- [0x08](./0x08-recursion) : Recursion - A function that calls itself in itself. You get to understand factorials too.
- [0x09](./0x09-static_libraries) : Static libraries.
- [0x0A](./0x0A-argc_argv) : Argument Counts and Argument Vectors, argc, argv[].
- [0x0B](./0x0B-malloc_free) : Dynamic and Automatic Allocation. Malloc, free.
- [0x0C](./0x0C-more_malloc_free) : More malloc, free.
- [0x0D](./0x0D-preprocessor) : Preprocessors.
- [0x0E](./0x0E-structures_typedef) : Structures, typedef.
- [0x0F](./0x0F-function_pointers) : Function pointers.
- [0x10](./0x10-variadic_functions) : Variadic functions.
- [0x11](https://github.com/AyomideKayode/printf) :  Printf. A Custom implementation of the C programming language '`printf`' function. My eyes saw red while doing this project. I almost cried. We were tasked to write our own printf project.
- [0x12](./0x12-singly_linked_lists) : Singly Linked Lists.
- [0x13](./0x13-more_singly_linked_lists) : More Singly Linked Lists.
- [0x14](./0x14-bit_manipulation) : Bit manipulation.
- [0x15](./0x15-file_io) : File I/O.
- [0x17](./0x17-doubly_linked_lists/) : Doubly Linked Lists.
- [0x18](./0x18-dynamic_libraries/) : Dynamic Libraries.
- [0x19](https://github.com/AyomideKayode/monty) : Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
