## 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops.

- Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,

* specific to the C programming language:
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## Synopsis

This project introduces functions and nested loops in C programming. Each .c file contains a different function while the holberton.h file contains all the function prototypes.

### Description of what each file does

* main --- directory(folder) containing all main.c files.
    * main.c files ----- holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
    * Files that start with:
    * 0. prints "Holberton"
    * 1. prints the alphabet, in lowercase
    * 2. prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
    * 3. checks for lowercase character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
    * 4. checks for alphabetic character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
    * 5. prints the sign of a number
    * 6. computes the absolute value of an integer
    * 7. prints the last digit of a number
    * 8. prints every minute starting from 00:00 to 23:59
    * 9. prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
    * 10. adds two integers and returns the result
    * 11. prints all natural numbers from n to 98
    * 100. prints the n times table, starting with 0
    * 101. computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
    * 102. prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
    * 103. considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, this program finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms
    * 104. finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
				* For every task, the requirement was to have a subsequent ```main.c``` file created for the task.
    * The `main.c` file would contain parameters to be met by whatever code we write into our own task file.
    * And for every prototype we have been instruted to use, they must be added into a `main.h` file.

### Environment

* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
