Tasks on C: Pointers, Arrays and Strings.

All ```*main.c``` files are examples given from the tasks. It is not a requirement to have them. 

Task 0: a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value of the int to 98

Task 1: a function that swaps the values of two integers

Task 2: a function that returns the length of a string

Task 3: a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout

Task 4: a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line

Task 5: a function that reverses a string

Task 6: a function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line

Task 7: a function that prints half of a string, and (length_of_string - 1) / 2 if odd length

Task 8: a function that prints n elements of an array of integers

Task 9: a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest

Task 10: a function that converts a string to an integer - the number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters; - need to take into account all the -(negative) and +(positive) signs before the number; - if there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0; - not allowed to use long; - not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array; - not allowed to hard-code special values; - code needs to work on both ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS -code will be compiled with -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag (You can install the last version on your VM); - code will be compiled with gcc version 5 or above;

Task 11: a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme
