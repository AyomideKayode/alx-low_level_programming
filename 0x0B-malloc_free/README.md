Tasks on Memory allocation.

Concepts to be learned in this repository:

- What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- What is malloc and free and how to use them
- Why and when use malloc
- How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

Description of what each file shows:

- a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char
- a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter
- a function that concatenates two strings
- a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
- a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function
- a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program
- a function that splits a string into words
