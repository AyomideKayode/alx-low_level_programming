Debugging Tasks in C.
Task 0: I needed to create a ```positive_or_negative.c``` file and add some function to test for positive and negative numbers. Then a ```0-main.c``` file based on the example given. then update my ```main.h``` file with the prototype function so it can be called back when i use it in the ```positive_or_negative.c``` file.

Task 1: The ```i``` variable was not incremented and this is the main reason for the indefinite loop. So i commented out the entire ```while``` loop(statement). And then make sure the line count is exactly 24. The beginning and end of the comments will make use of the regular space that is between codes.

Task 2: Corrections to be made to the given code to make sure all integers are compared with each other before declaring one to be the largest. An ```if``` statement, two ```else if``` and one ```else``` should do the trick.

Task 3: Code needed to be rewritten to make provision for leap years. So the if conditions had to be tweaked a bit.
