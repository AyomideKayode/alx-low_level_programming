Debugging Tasks in C.
Task 0: I needed to create a ```positive_or_negative.c``` file and add some function to test for positive and negative numbers. Then a ```0-main.c``` file based on the example given. then update my ```main.h``` file with the prototype function so it can be called back when i use it in the ```positive_or_negative.c``` file.

Task 1: The ```i``` variable was not incremented and this is the main reason for the indefinite loop. So i commented out the entire ```while``` loop(statement).
