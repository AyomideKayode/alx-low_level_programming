Tasks on Argument Count and Argument Vector in C programming language.

Concepts to be learned in this repository:

- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use attribute((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

Description of what each file shows:

Task 0 - a program that prints its name

Task 1 - a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it: this should exclude the program name itself. Which result in specifying in our code that ```argc -1```

Task 2 - a program that prints all arguments it receives

Task 3 - a program that multiplies two numbers
Task 4 - a program that adds positive numbers: achieved this by creating an helper function. Which first determines if the argument passed is a number or not. And then the normal fucntion that adds positive numbers.
Task 5 - a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money
