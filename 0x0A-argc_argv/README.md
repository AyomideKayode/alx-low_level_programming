Tasks on Argument Count and Argument Vector in C programming language.

Concepts to be learned in this repository:

- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use attribute((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

Description of what each file shows:

- a program that prints its name
- a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it
- a program that prints all arguments it receives
- a program that multiplies two numbers
- a program that adds positive numbers: achieved this by creating an helper function. Which first determines if the argument passed is a number or not. And then the normal fucntion that adds positive numbers.
- a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money
