More Tasks on Pointers, Arrays and Strings in C.

Task 0: function that concatenates two strings

Task 1: function that returns and concatenates n bytes of another string

Task 2: function that returns and copies n bytes of a string and fills '\0' till end of n bytes

Task 3: function that compares two strings and returns a number re distance of values

Task 4: function that reverses the content of an array of integers

Task 5: function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

Task 6: function that capitalizes first letter of all words of a string

Task 7: function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet)

Task 8: function that encodes a string using rot13

Task 9: function that prints an integer

Task 10: modify set code so program prints ```a[2] = 98``` under certain constraints
- not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
- not allowed to modify the variable p
- not allowed to use
- not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
- code should be written at line 19, before the ```;```
- donâ€™t change anything but the line of code you are adding

Task 11: function that adds two numbers

Task 12: function that prints a buffer.
- must print the content of size bytes of the buffer pointed by b 
- output should print 10 bytes per line 
- each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with 0 
- each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space 
- each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character, print the letter, if not, print ```.```
- each line ends with a new line \n - if size is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only \n
