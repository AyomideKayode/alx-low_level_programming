## Recursion - C Programming language.

* Concepts to be learned in this repository:
	- what recursion is and how to use it
	- How to implement recursion
	- In what situations you should implement recursion
	- In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

### Description of what each file shows:
* main.h ----------- holds files' function prototypes.
* main --- directory(folder) containing all main.c files.
* main.c files ----- holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions

* Files that start with:
0. a function that prints a string, followed by a new line (puts)
1. a function that prints a string in reverse
2. a function that returns the length of a string
3. a function that returns the factorial of a given number
	- If `n` is lower than `0`, the function should return `-1` to indicate an error
	- Factorial of `0` is `1`
4. a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` (pow)
	- If `y` is lower than `0`, the function should return `-1`
5. a function that returns the natural square root of a number. With the help of an helper function .i.e a function you create inside the square root function to assist with geting the sqrt.
	- If `n` does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
6. a function that returns `1` if the input integer is a `prime number`, otherwise return `0`
7. a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not
8. a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0
	- `s2` can contain the special character `*`.
	- The special char `*` can replace any string (including an empty string)

### Environment
* Language: C
	* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
	* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
	* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
