## Learning Objectives

### General

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

## More Info

### Data Structure and Functions:
* For this project you are given the following `print_array`, and `print_list` functions:
	```sh
	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <stdio.h>

	/**
	* print_array - Prints an array of integers
	*
	* @array: The array to be printed
	* @size: Number of elements in @array
	*/
	void print_array(const int *array, size_t size)
	{
		size_t i;

		i = 0;
		while (array && i < size)
		{
			if (i > 0)
				printf(", ");
			printf("%d", array[i]);
			++i;
		}
		printf("\n");
	}
	```
	```sh
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include "sort.h"

	/**
	* print_list - Prints a list of integers
	*
	* @list: The list to be printed
	*/
	void print_list(const listint_t *list)
	{
		int i;

		i = 0;
		while (list)
		{
			if (i > 0)
				printf(", ");
			printf("%d", list->n);
			++i;
			list = list->next;
		}
		printf("\n");
	}
	```

	- Our files `print_array.c` and `print_list.c` (containing the `print_array` and `print_list` functions) will be compiled with your functions during the correction.
	- Please declare the prototype of the functions `print_array` and `print_list` in your `sort.h` header file
	- Please use the following data structure for doubly linked list:
	```sh
	/**
	* struct listint_s - Doubly linked list node
	*
	* @n: Integer stored in the node
	* @prev: Pointer to the previous element of the list
	* @next: Pointer to the next element of the list
	*/
	typedef struct listint_s
	{
		const int n;
		struct listint_s *prev;
		struct listint_s *next;
	} listint_t;
	```

* Please, note this format is used for Quiz and Task questions.

	- `O(1)`
	- `O(n)`
	- `O(n!)`
	- n square -> `O(n^2)`
	- log(n) -> `O(log(n))`
	- n * log(n) -> `O(nlog(n))`
	- n + k -> `O(n+k)`
	- ‚Ä¶
- Please use the ‚Äúshort‚Äù notation (don‚Äôt use constants). Example: `O(nk)` or `O(wn)` should be written `O(n)`. If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.

### Tests
* Here is a quick tip to help you test your sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers: [Random.org](https://www.random.org/integer-sets/)


## Description of what each files show (Tasks):
* main	--- folder that will hold the `main.c` files used as test cases for functions we'd be creating.
* sort.h	--- header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures.
* notes	--- markdown that contains thoughts and frustrations to better help me understand the algorithms.
* Files that start with:

0. [Bubble Sort](./0-bubble_sort.c) :
- Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm.
	- Prototype: `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
	- You‚Äôre expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
- Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
	- in the best case
	- in the average case
	- in the worst case
