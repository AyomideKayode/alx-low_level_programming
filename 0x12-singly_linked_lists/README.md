> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
	> specific to the C programming language:
	> how to build, use, and free singly linked lists

### Description of what each file shows:
	* lists.h ----------- holds files' function prototypes and a sample struct linked list.
	* main --- directory(folder) containing all main.c files.
	* main.c files ----- holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
	* Files that start with:
	0. a function that prints all elements of a linked list
	1. a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list
	2. a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list
	3. a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list
