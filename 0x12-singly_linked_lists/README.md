## Singly Linked Lists.
	> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
 	> specific to the C programming language:
   	> how to build, use, and free singly linked lists

### Description of what each file shows:
	* lists.h ----------- holds files' function prototypes and a sample struct linked list.
	* main --- directory(folder) containing all main.c files.
	* main.c files ----- holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
	* Files that start with:
	0. a function that prints all elements of a linked list
	1. a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list
	2. a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list
	3. a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list
	4. a function that free a linked list
	5. a function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the main function is executed.
	- You are allowed to use the printf function.
	- In this task, filename is ```100-first.c```.
	6. Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints ```Hello, Holberton```, followed by a new line.
	- You are only allowed to use the printf function
	- You are not allowed to use interrupts
	- Your program will be compiled using nasm and gcc
	- Compilation command is ```nasm -f elf64 101-hello_holberton.asm && gcc -no-pie -std=gnu89 101-hello_holberton.o -o hello```.
	- Filename for this task is ```101-hello_holberton.asm```.

### Environment
	* Language: C
	* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
	* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
	* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
